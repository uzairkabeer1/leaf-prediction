# leaf-prediction
This is the website that will prediction the type of leaf and whether the leaf is diseased or healthy. It will distinguish betwwen 8 leaves (Mango, Guava, Jamun, Jatropha,Pongamia Pinnata, Pomegranate, Lemon. Chinar).
Based on the dataset and under specific conditions the model gave 97% accuracy on predicting the validation dataset.

# Limitation

# Run
In order to run this on local host you can first download the packages listed in `Requirements.txt`
Then
`python app.py`

You can sucessfully run the flask website and predict the images.
